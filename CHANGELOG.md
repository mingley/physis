# Changelog

Every change to `physis` is atomic, committed directly to `main`, agentically
reviewed, and recorded here with its rationale and the verification that backs
it. This log is part of the contract: the process is meant to be as inspectable
as the physics.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
The project keeps `unsafe`-free pure Rust and honest epistemic tags.

## [Unreleased]

### M1 — String lab

- **M1.2 More constructions first-class** (`crates/physis-theory/src/strings.rs`,
  `critique.rs`, `lab.rs`). Type I, Type IIA, heterotic SO(32), and M-theory are
  now constructed and registered in both the default lab and the `string-critique`
  matrix — ten objects in all. Their distinctive verdicts are pinned by tests:
  SO(32) constructions (Type I, heterotic SO(32)) carry an encoded SM embedding
  (`sm-gauge` holds); Type IIA and M-theory have no perturbative GUT group
  (`sm-gauge` undecidable); M-theory sits at critical dimension 11; and every
  default string construction fails `unique-vacuum` as a heuristic.

- **M1.1 Journal replay** (`crates/physis-agent/src/replay.rs`).
  Deterministic replay of a recorded JSONL journal onto a fresh
  `Lab::standard()`. `replay_journal` re-applies every `set-knob`, recomputes
  the verdict diffs, and checks them against what was recorded. A faithful
  replay is a mechanical proof of reproducibility; the CLI `physis replay
  <file.jsonl>` exits non-zero on any mismatch or failed turn.
  - New: `Journal::from_jsonl`, `ReplayReport`/`ReplayStep`, `Command::Replay`.
  - `VerdictDiff` gained `PartialEq`/`Eq` so recorded and recomputed diffs are
    comparable.
  - Tests: round-trip faithfulness, tamper detection, failed-turn reporting,
    empty-journal, and multi-run resume (`crates/physis-agent/src/replay.rs`).

- **M1.6 Session persistence** (`crates/physis/src/main.rs`).
  `physis --journal <file.jsonl>` records a session across process runs. On
  each run the lab loads the file and **restores prior state**
  (`Lab::restore_from_journal`) before applying the new turn, so a multi-run
  session is a single coherent, replayable session rather than a bag of
  independent one-shot diffs.

### Fixed

- **Journals were silently unreadable from disk.** Journal event timestamps
  were `u128`, and serde's internally tagged enum representation drops 128-bit
  integers on deserialization — so every event written by `Journal::file` was
  dropped when the file was reloaded. Timestamps are now `u64` Unix millis
  (range good for ~584 million years). Caught by the M1.1 replay round-trip
  test, not by inspection.
- **Journal events recorded `t: 0`.** `set-knob`/`run`/`experiment` events were
  stamped with `0` instead of the real time. They now use stamping constructors
  (`JournalEvent::set_knob` / `run` / `experiment`).

### Verification

Every change above is covered by `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and
`cargo test --workspace` (all suites green — unit tests + doctests, including
the compile-fail proof that mass cannot be added to length and the replay
round-trip), plus the CLI record→replay loop demonstrated end-to-end.
Agentically reviewed with bugbot; the malformed/empty-journal certification
gap it flagged is fixed and covered by tests.

## Environment

- **Cloud Agent environment** (`.cursor/environment.json`). Repo-managed config
  for the pure-Rust workspace: toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`, `install`
  fetches and warm-builds all targets. Validated on a fresh build + fresh
  Cloud Agent.
